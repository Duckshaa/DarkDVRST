# DarkDVRST
Low-light Violence Detection using Deep Learning and Image Processing
DarkDVRST (Dark Environment Deep-Learning based Violence Detection using RetinexNet and Spatio-Temporal Analysis) is a deep learning-based project aimed at detecting violent activities in low-light video footage. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and spatio-temporal analysis, the model enhances video quality and extracts meaningful features for accurate classification. The implementation is built using TensorFlow and Keras, incorporating multiple neural network architectures to improve detection performance in challenging environments.

The project is structured into various modules to handle different aspects of the workflow, including data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation. It utilizes Retinex-based low-light enhancement to improve visibility, followed by a combination of convolutional neural networks and transformers for feature extraction and temporal analysis. The model is trained on a dataset of violent and non-violent video sequences, applying spatio-temporal learning to capture both spatial and motion-based patterns.

A key aspect of the project is the synchronization of multi-camera feeds to enhance situational awareness in real-time applications. Optical flow analysis is employed to track motion intensity and detect aggressive behaviour, while machine learning classifiers further refine the predictions. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are used to improve model generalization and robustness across different lighting conditions and video resolutions.

The implementation requires Python 3.6 or higher, along with essential deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and scikit-learn. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of pre-labelled video samples categorized into violent and non-violent events. The training process is designed with optimized callbacks, including learning rate scheduling and checkpointing, to ensure stable convergence and performance improvement.

This project serves as a foundation for real-world applications in security surveillance, law enforcement, and public safety, where low-light video analysis is crucial for identifying potential threats. By integrating deep learning with multi-camera coordination and behavioural analysis, DarkDVRST offers a scalable approach to automated violence detection in complex environments.
